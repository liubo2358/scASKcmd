Abstract: 
This collection of data is part of the RNA-Seq (HiSeq) PANCAN data set, it is a random extraction of gene expressions of patients having different types of tumor: BRCA, KIRC, COAD, LUAD and PRAD.

Data Set Information:
Samples (instances) are stored row-wise. Variables (attributes) of each sample are RNA-Seq gene expression levels measured by illumina HiSeq platform.
